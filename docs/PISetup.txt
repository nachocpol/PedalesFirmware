====================
Raspberry setup
====================
-- Hardware: PI 3 Model A+
-- Micro Sd
====================

1) Download imager from https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
2) Follow steps in https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/2
3) Install Raspberry PI os 32bit
4) Wait..
5) Once done, insert card into the raspberry
6) Connect your keyboard and mouse (I had to use a usb spliter as the PI3 only has one USB port)
7) Connect the HDMI cable
8) Connect power...
9) You should now see the OS starting up
10) Configure the PI
11) Create a default user and password for the pi
12) Connected to the local Wifi
13) Once connected, do a system update, this can take a few minutes
14) Will ask for a re-start. Go ahead
15) Run on a terminal
	-> sudo apt update
	-> sudo apt upgrade
This shouldn't do anything as we already installed it during the OS setup, but better be sure
16) Lets go ahead and setup a remote desktop connection
17) Get device IP
	-> hostname -I
Make a note of this IP
18) Install the remote host software
	-> sudo apt install xrdp
19) Once this is done, the software should be good to go
20) However, we need to add a new user to connect remotely (for whatever reason, the root user can't be used to connect)
	-> sudo adduser <remoteUsername>
Follow the steps. 
21) Can verify from a windows PC using remote desktop
	Connect using the <remoteUsername> and password and providing the IP
Keep in mind that if you also have the HDMI connected at the same time this will be super slow.
Another thing to remember, you can (and should) reduce the resolution of the RDC windows client (I have 4k monitors, and defaults to that size) to ensure good connection quality.  Also, you can reduce the color quality (I have it at the lowest)
