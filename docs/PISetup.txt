=========================
Raspberry SETUP
PI3 Model a+ (supports 64bit)
=========================


1) Download the Raspberry PI imager
2) Select OS -> Raspberry PI OS (64bit) IMPORTANT: Must be 64 bit to support influxdb
3) In the settings, we can already go ahead and configure a username and SSH hostname
	- I'm setting hostname to default
	- Enable SSH (use pass)
	- Set username and password IMPORTANT: remember this, this is your root user
	- Configure wifi, set SSID and password
4) Hit Write, wait
5) Once this is done, we can insert the microSD and go ahead an power the PI

6) Through a remote SSH client (I'm using windows, so PUTTY is the choice) connect to the PI
7) Set the hostname to raspberrypi.local (or whatever you used) port 22 and protocol to SSH
8) Connect
9) Will ask for username. Use the one provided during the install
10)We should be able to run commands
11)Lets retrieve the ip by doing 
	hostname -I
12) Ensure everything is uptodate:
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade -y

=========================
InfluxDB
=========================

1) Setup influxdb key and repo

wget -qO- https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdb.gpg > /dev/null
export DISTRIB_ID=$(lsb_release -si); export DISTRIB_CODENAME=$(lsb_release -sc)
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/influxdb.gpg] https://repos.influxdata.com/${DISTRIB_ID,,} ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdb.list > /dev/null


2) Get and install

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install influxdb2

3) Go! This will ensure the service starts on reboot

	sudo service influxdb start

4) We can verify by doing:

	sudo service influxdb status

5) From the remote PC we can navigate to

	http://<IP>:8086/

6) Lets setup InfluxDB now
	- Create username -> influxpi
	- Password        -> influxpi
	- Org		  -> pedalesOrg
	- Bucket	  -> pedales

7) Done, the InfluxDB is up and running ready to recieve connections
